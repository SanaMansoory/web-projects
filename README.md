Built My First Unit Converter — Beginner Dev Moment 🚀📏💻

Honestly, I didn’t plan this at all.
I was just practicing HTML, CSS & JavaScript when I thought —
"Hmm… what if I make something small but super useful?" 🤔💡
And boom 💥 — the idea of a Unit Converter popped into my head!

This little web app lets you convert values instantly between different units.
Choose your category, select your units, enter a number… and magic happens! ✨

⚡ Features:
🔹 Convert between Length, Weight, Temperature, and Currency and many more.
🔹 Instant results as soon as you click convert
🔹 Clean & pastel-friendly design for a smooth user experience 🎨
🔹 Basic error handling so it doesn’t break if you leave inputs empty 🚫

🛠 Tech Used:
💻 HTML → Structure
🎨 CSS → Styling
⚙️ JavaScript → Conversion logic + DOM manipulation

This is my first ever project, and seeing it work gave me a major confidence boost! 💪
Can’t wait to build more! 🚀
